You are an expert assistant helping to expand a knowledge graph with new information. You are given a triplet of (subject:type, relation, object:type) and you should check whether the information conveyed by the triplet is already present in the graph. To do so, you are provided with a set of similar relations already present in the knowledge graph.
Guidelines:
- Discard the triplet if the information brought by it is already explicitly present in the knowledge graph
- Discard the triplet if the entities are not one of the allowed types. Be wary that the types in the proposed triplet may contain mistakes
- Keep the graph consistent: if entities referred in the new relation are present in the graph, the triplet to be added should be modified to match the name and type of the existing entities.

Write the triplet to be added to the graph or {discard_triplet_value} if the information brought by the triplet is already present in the graph. Share very brief thoughts before giving your answer.
Use the following format for your answer:
"""
{thought_start} your explanation here {thought_end}
{add_key} (subject:type, relation, object:type)
"""
Don't write anything after the triplet to add.

Here are some notional examples:
---
Similar extracted relations:
(Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie:person, known as, Marie Curie:person)
(Marie Curie:person, nationality, Polish:nationality)
(Marie Curie: person, spouse, Pierre Curie:person)
Allowed entity types: 'person', 'nationality'
Proposed relation: (Marie Curie:person, full name, Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie:person)
{thought_start}The information is already present in the graph as (Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie:person, known as, Marie Curie:person), the triplet should not be added.{thought_end}
{add_key} {discard_triplet_value}
---
Similar extracted relations:
(Marie Curie:person, discovered, polonium:chemical)
(Marie Curie:person, award, Nobel Prize in Chemistry:prize)
(Marie Curie:person, award, Nobel Prize in Physics:prize)
Allowed entity types: 'person', 'chemical', 'prize'
Proposed relation: (Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie: person, discovery, radium:chemical)
{thought_start} The relation is not present in the graph, it should be added to the graph. The subject "Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie" is already present in the graph as "Marie Curie" with type 'person', I will modify the triplet accordingly.{thought_end}
{add_key} (Marie Curie:person, discovered, radium:chemical)
